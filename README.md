# 👋 Hey Team IDL!

I'm U Gopika Das, a final-year student in Electronics and Computer Engineering from LBS Institute of Technology for Women, Trivandrum.

This is my first time working on a **real-time AI debate platform**, and honestly, it’s been a wild learning ride. From figuring out the basics to setting up backend automation, I’ve tried to give this project everything I’ve got.

Our team is called **AI_innovators**, and we’re participating in **Track B** of this challenge. We’ve been testing features, tweaking ideas, and exploring how AI can help spark meaningful debates. It’s far from perfect—but it’s definitely ours!

## 📝 A Note from Me

I’ve spent the last month completely dedicated to building this platform—from long nights of debugging to celebrating those tiny “it finally works!” moments.

If you’re checking it out, I’d *really* appreciate your thoughts. Let me know what worked well, what could be better, or even just what you felt while using it. Your feedback would mean a lot—and help me grow not just as a developer, but as a learner.

Thanks for taking the time to explore my work!

— U Gopika Das 🌸
